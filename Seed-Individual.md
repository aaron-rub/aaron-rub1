## Team collaboration
I feel as if in my past tri's that I was not very outgoing and reaching out to others, a big part of that was that I would always rely on the same group over and over. This prevented my own personal growth and learning, this tri I had decided to try something new and collaborate with newer bigger groups. I am participating in group meetings [meeting](https://github.com/John-sCC/jcc_frontend/issues/43) starting to get highly organized.
