# Aaron Rubin College Board Notes

### Key Vocab
- Logical Operator
A logical operator is a symbol or word used to connect two or more expressions
- Strings
series of characters (numbers, letters, etc), one example of a string is your name or your id because strings can contain both numbers and letters.
- Lists
sequences of elements with each element being a variable. An example of a list can be the names of the students in this classroom.
- What is an algorithms?
An algorithm is a finite set of instruction that accomplish a task, it can be expressed by natural language, diagrams, and various other ways.
What are the three parts of an algorithm?
Sequencing, selection, and iteration.

Every algorithm can be created by a mixture of sequencing, selection, and iteration

- Sequence?
A sequence is the order of how to do something to achieve a result, similarly to how you follow the instructions from a teacher.
- Selection?
A selection allows an algorithm to make a decision based on if a condition is met, an example of this is when your car is out of fuel, you go to the gas station to fill your car, but if your car is full you wouldn’t go to the gas station.
- Iteration?
An iteration is a loop and doing something again until a condition is met, like you put away your computer when you are finished with your work.
- Substring?
A substring is part of an existing string
- If statement
if proved true, performs a function
- Variable
a value that can change depending on the conditions
- Jupyter
lets you write and run code at the same time
- Push/Pull
to send / recieve code to and from Github
- Markdown
syntac used to format plain text
Define
defining a function or method
- Front matter
a section of code that is on top of files with key-values
Boolean
value that is either true or false
- Square brackets
[lists and tuples go inside]:
- For Loop
used for repeating a sequence
- Metadata
a set of data that describes and gives information about other data.
- Binary
a coding system using the binary digits 0 and 1 to represent a letter, digit, or other character in a computer or other electronic device. Calculate numbers by using the tens place method.
- Preprocessing
A step in the data mining and data analysis process that takes raw data and transforms it into a format (HTML) that can be understood and analyzed by computers and machine learning.
- Abstraction Process
Through the process of abstraction, a programmer hides all but the relevant data about an object in order to reduce complexity and increase efficiency.
- Liquid
Code that exits in the programming environment, but gets converted to something else when sent to the browser

### Big Idea 5.3 Computing Bias


## Notes

- Google “What age groups use Facebook” vs “… TikTok”? What does the data say? Is there purposeful exclusion in these platforms? Is it harmful? Should it be corrected? Is it good business?
- - The average age of people who use TikTok are like ~9-27 and facebook ~25-34+. I feel like there is an invisible exclusion. The older people probably use Facebook because it was the first one avaliabe to them, and TikTok is too fast pace and new gen for them. It is good for buisness, having a concentrated amount of your users being in a certain age gap is good because it allows you to focus more on the group instead of trying to improve the experience for multiple different ones.

- Why do virtual assistants have female voices? Amazon, Alexa Google, Apple Siri. Was this purposeful? Is it harmful? Should it be corrected? Is it good business?
- - This was likely purposeful, it was probably due to people feeling more comfortable when using this. Sexism  alo could have played a big role in this, it plays the stereotype that assistants are usually female.

- Talk about an algorithm that influences your decisions, think about these companies (ie FAANG - Facebook, Amazon, Apple,Netflix, Google)
- - A reccomended page, e.g(Netflix, TikTok, Instagtam) They all use data collected from your user and display items that you find appealing based off of your data.
