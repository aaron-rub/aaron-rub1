    "Write an interface named NumberGroup that represents a group of integers. The interface should have a single contains method that determines if a given integer is in the group. For example, if group1 is of type NumberGroup, and it contains only the two numbers -5 and 3, then group1.contains(-5) would return true, and group1.contains(2) would return false. Write the complete NumberGroup interface. It must have exactly one method.\n"

    "This FRQ dives into Classes and Interfaces, making us work with an interface called NumberGroup to check if specific numbers are part of different groups. We created a few classes: one that stores numbers in a list, another that defines a range of numbers, and a third that combines multiple ranges. It's all about using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and abstraction to make our code neat, easy to write, and even easier to update. We had to override a method to fit our needs, whether it was checking a list, a range, or multiple ranges."
